             <p>Give to the needy today. The covid-19 pandemic has hit us hard than good and low income-families suffer most. Low-income families who are strongly to feed can not provide essential services to their families. Your gift today can help make a change to their families and their communities. Without the donations we received from December 2020 till date from individuals and corporation organizations donors, our ongoing back to school campaign could not be possible.</p>
